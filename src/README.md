# Core UI  - Angular (src/)

Project sources are broken down into 2 main modules:

#### Lib

+ Contains core UI libraries 

 
 
 #### Playground
 
 + _Playground_ is regular _angular-cli_ application where we test and try different 
 things with this library. Playground imports _@aribaui_ libraries just like any other application 
 consuming this library would.
