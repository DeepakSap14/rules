# Core UI  - Angular (lib/)

**Lib** is broken down into 4 main modules. To get more understanding how things work we 
recommended to dive into **sources**.

### app

+ Application framework level components and services
+ This will be soon extracted out of this project into its own repository as ```app``` should 
contain only Ariba private and proprietary code.
