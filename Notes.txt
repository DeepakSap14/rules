Todo:

- Theming

- deprecate our HTTP implementation  - DefaultHttp as there is new API in place HttpClient whcih
now adds all we have in DefaultHttp and much more.

-includeComponent: ngOnChanges is called before IncludeComponent:ngOnInit() is called. However,
 because ngOnChanges calls doRenderComponent(), the included component is rendered twice, once
 in ngOnChanges() and once ngOnInit(). We should prevent the component being rendered before
 ngOnInit().

- Implement MetaTabs so we can render high level menu

 /*editable=false {
            component:HyperlinkComponent;
            bindings: {
                action: ${
                    this.set("object", value);
                    this.set("actionCategory", "General");
                    this.set("action", "Inspect");
                    meta.fireAction(this, true)
                };
                ngcontent: $value;
            }
        }*/


- look at the https://github.com/petebacondarwin/dgeni-example to see if we can use it to generate
markup documentation files


- Revisit building processing for libraries. please see hints from:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/edit


- update dialog to be able to say I want to position it in center of the page and not within closes
element. And maybe introduce new biding that could tell dialog to fully expand. Now you have to pass
null to make the dialog set it with to 100%.


- update i18n to delete all the files after which are not needed.

---------------------

scrollHeight should be default to some value as datable cannot take all the space
	- experiment

- resizing columns - based on primeNG
