### Tools

Tools contains two main folders:
 * **gulp**: All necessary scripts to execute CI tasks as well as to be able to build current 
 project as a library and publish it to the npm registry
 * **ide**: Intellij WebStorm/Idea plugin implementation for recognizing oss file type
  
  
### Gulp

All the tasks under this directory are derived and extended from existing project (material design2) 
as you can see in the license inside the files. Please checkout the `package.json` where we have all 
the scripts defined
